For the Github lab in course CYBR 8480

Hi, this is Zexi, who is currently taking the course CYBR 8480

I am very interested on doing some IoT analysis. For example, I know there was a malware called Mirai which caused large destructions on IoT devices in the
United States in 2016. Those IoT devices infected by Mirai will continue scan the other adjacent devices and go ahead compromise them.

I hope I can get a good grade in this course.
